    abstract = { Distributed denial-of-service is one kind of the most highlighted and most important attacks of today’s cyberworld. With simple but extremely powerful attack mechanisms, it introduces an immense threat to current Internet community. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of distributed denial-of-service attack, prevention, and mitigation techniques. We provide a systematic analysis of this type of attacks including motivations and evolution, analysis of different attacks so far, protection techniques and mitigation techniques, and possible limitations and challenges of existing research. Finally, some important research directions are outlined which require more attentions in near future to ensure successful defense against distributed denial-of-service attacks. }

abstract = { Slow HTTP Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are defined as application layer vulnerabilities that make HTTP services degrade their performance or reach a denial state. The Slow HTTP DoS attacks can evade the generic DoS attack detection techniques because of their low volume but long lasting attack traffic. Existing solutions on Slow HTTP DoS attack detection mainly rely on static threshold based detection techniques or supervised machine learning techniques. However, the use of unsupervised learning techniques has not been widely studied. This paper proposes capsAEUL, which uses multiple Autoencoders as an unsupervised learning technique for detecting all of Slowloris, Slowread, and Slow POST of Slow HTTP DoS attack as an integrated system. The PoC implementation of capsAEUL exhibits the comparable prediction performance in terms of the high accuracy and the decent AUC scores.},
